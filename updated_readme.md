## Introduction

This repository contains educational materials for learning programming concepts, Python file operations, and statistical data analysis. It includes worksheets, project guidelines, and teaching resources for a statistics project.

## Getting Started with GitHub and VS Code

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code repositories. It uses Git for version control, allowing you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your code effectively.

### Using VS Code in GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment directly in your browser. When you open this repository in Codespaces, you'll have access to VS Code with all necessary extensions and tools pre-configured.

#### VS Code Interface Basics

- **Explorer (Ctrl+Shift+E)**: View and manage files in your repository
- **Source Control (Ctrl+Shift+G)**: Manage Git operations
- **Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)**: Install and manage VS Code extensions
- **Terminal (Ctrl+`)**: Open integrated terminal
- **Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)**: Access VS Code commands

### Essential Git Commands

Here are some basic Git commands you'll use in this repository:

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Check status of your repository
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.py        # Add specific file
git add .                  # Add all files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push

# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b branch-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout branch-name
```

### Useful Bash Commands

When working in the terminal, these commands will be helpful:

```bash
# Navigate directories
cd directory_name    # Change to specified directory
cd ..               # Go up one directory
pwd                 # Print current directory

# List files
ls                  # List files in current directory
ls -la              # List all files (including hidden) with details

# Create and manipulate files/directories
mkdir directory_name    # Create directory
touch filename.txt      # Create empty file
rm filename.txt         # Remove file
rm -r directory_name    # Remove directory and contents

# View file contents
cat filename.txt        # Display file contents
less filename.txt       # View file with pagination
head -n 10 filename.txt # View first 10 lines
tail -n 10 filename.txt # View last 10 lines

# Run Python scripts
python script.py        # Run Python script
```

## Repository Contents

### Python File Operations

The `Python File Reading Worksheet.md` contains exercises for learning how to:

- Understand file paths (absolute vs. relative)
- Open and read files in Python
- Work with file operations like `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`
- Use the `with` statement for file handling
- Process data from files

### Statistics Project Materials

This repository includes resources for a multi-day statistics project:

- Lesson plans and daily activities
- Team formation templates
- Data exploration worksheets
- Project planning templates
- Progress reporting forms
- Analytical worksheets for data interpretation

## How to Use These Materials

1. Begin with the Python file operations worksheet to learn essential file handling concepts
2. Explore the statistics project materials to understand the data analysis workflow
3. Follow the daily lesson plans in sequence for a structured learning experience
4. Complete the worksheets and templates as you progress through the project

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to these educational materials:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add your feature"`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`)
6. Open a Pull Request
